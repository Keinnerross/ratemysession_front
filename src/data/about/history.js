  content: `Founded in 2025, Rate My Session was born from the need for a platform that could bridge the gap between therapy seekers and the professionals who guide them.

The idea emerged from the understanding that finding the right therapist can be overwhelming, and sometimes the decision is made without adequate information. We wanted to create a space where people could share their experiences, learn from one another, and feel empowered in their mental health journey.`,
